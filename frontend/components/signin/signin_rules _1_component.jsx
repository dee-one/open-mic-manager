        <span>This is the Comedy Corner's mic sign up. Sign up DAY OF SHOW, any time after 10am CST. The list goes up right around 8-9pm, with the show starting at 10pm.
         </span>
         <span>
        If you have friends/family coming, they gotta get tickets on our website ahead of attending. Please make sure people in your party know it DOES NOT SAVE THEM A SEAT.
        </span>
       <span>
        The mic can start filling up as early as 9:30pm, ask people coming to see you to arrive early.

        When you're new expect 3 minute sets about once a month, which sucks but is as fair as we've been able to figure it out.

        <span>We use your email to identify you, so make sure you use the same one every week, even a typo can fuck up our very NOT-FAIL-PROOF system.</span>
